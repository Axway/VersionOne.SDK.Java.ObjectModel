## Introduction

The VersionOne object model library was created to provide a strongly-typed VersionOne object model, in library form, allowing developers to easily and quickly develop VersionOne integrations and complementary applications and utilities - without concern for the underlying APIClient or server-side REST API. As illustrated below, the object model depends on the APIClient, which in turn communicates via http/https with the VersionOne API.
