The ObjectModel library provide a strongly-typed model on top of the [VersionOne SDK.Java API Client library](https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Java.APIClient). This allows developers to easily and quickly develop VersionOne integrations and complementary applications/utilities using domain objects (Project, Story, Iteration, etc) instead of more abstract objects (Asset, Attribute). The ObjectModel is suitable for fine-grained access, such as creating new VersionOne assets.

## How to get the library as a precompiled package

_Do this if you only want to use the functionality, but are not interested in compiling from source or in contributing code to the project._

You can use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to import the SDK.Java Object Model and its dependencies in your project by making use of Maven Central (http://search.maven.org). You can edit the [pom.xml](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) file for your project in order to import the current version of the SDK.Java Object Model into your project. Alternatively, you can download the jar and documentation from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22VersionOne.SDK.Java.ObjectModel%22). If you wish, instead, to pull the source code down and integrate it with your project, you can clone the GitHub repository for [SDK.Java Object Model](https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Java.ObjectModel).
