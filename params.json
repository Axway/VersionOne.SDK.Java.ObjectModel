This allows developers to easily and quickly develop VersionOne integrations and complementary applications/utilities using domain objects (Project, Story, Iteration, etc) instead of more abstract objects (Asset, Attribute). The ObjectModel is suitable for fine-grained access, such as creating new VersionOne assets.\r\n\r\nThis product includes software developed at VersionOne \r\n(http://versionone.com/).
